## 🚨 The Problem: AI "Thinking" is an Illusion

Everyone is trying to fix AI hallucinations by **Fine-Tuning** (teaching it more data).

This is like forcing a student to memorize 1,000,000 math problems.

**What happens when they see the 1,000,001st problem? They guess.**

---

## ✅ The Solution: Give the AI a Calculator

**QWED** doesn't try to make the LLM "smarter". 

It treats the LLM as an **untrusted translator** and verifies its output using **Deterministic Engines** (SymPy, Z3, SQLGlot, AST).

> *"If an AI writes code, QWED runs the security audit.*  
> *If an AI does math, QWED runs the calculus."*

## 🧠 The Philosophy

| ❌ Wrong Approach | ✅ QWED Approach |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Let's fine-tune the model to be more accurate" | "Let's verify the output with math" |
| "Trust the AI's confidence score" | "Trust the symbolic proof" |
| "Add more training data" | "Add a verification layer" |
| "Hope it doesn't hallucinate" | "Catch hallucinations deterministically" |

**QWED = Query with Evidence and Determinism**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Don't change your model. Just wrap your output.

```bash
pip install qwed
```

```python
from qwed_sdk import QWEDClient

client = QWEDClient(api_key="your_key")

# The LLM says: "Derivative of x^2 is 3x" (Hallucination!)
response = client.verify_math(
    query="What is the derivative of x^2?",
    llm_output="3x" 
)

print(response)
# -> ❌ CORRECTED: The derivative is 2x. (Verified by SymPy)
```

---

## 🔧 The 8 Deterministic Engines

We don't use another LLM to check your LLM. **That's circular logic.**

We use **Hard Engineering**:

| Engine | Tech Stack | What it Solves |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **🧮 Math** | `SymPy` + `NumPy` | Calculus, Linear Algebra, Finance. No more `$1 + $1 = $3`. |
| **⚖️ Logic** | `Z3 Prover` | Formal Verification. Checks for logical contradictions. |
| **🛡️ Code** | `AST` + `Semgrep` | Catches `eval()`, secrets, vulnerabilities before code runs. |
| **📊 Stats** | `Pandas` + `Wasm` | Sandboxed execution for trusted data analysis. |
| **🗄️ SQL** | `SQLGlot` | Prevents Injection & validates schema. |
| **🔍 Fact** | `TF-IDF` + `NLI` | Checks grounding against source docs. |
| **👁️ Image** | `OpenCV` + `Metadata` | Verifies image dimensions, format, pixel data. |
| **🤝 Consensus** | `Multi-Provider` | Cross-checks GPT-4 vs Claude vs Gemini. |

## 🌍 SDK Support

| Language | Package | Install |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 🐍 Python | `qwed` | `pip install qwed` |
| 🟦 TypeScript | `@qwed-ai/sdk` | `npm install @qwed-ai/sdk` |
| 🐹 Go | `qwed-go` | `go get github.com/qwed-ai/qwed-go` |
| 🦀 Rust | `qwed` | `cargo add qwed` |

## 🤔 How is QWED Different?

| Approach | What it Does | Why it's Not Enough |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **RLHF / Fine-tuning** | Teaches model with feedback | Still probabilistic, can't guarantee |
| **Guardrails** | Filters bad outputs | Reactive, not verification |
| **RAG** | Grounds answers in docs | Fixes knowledge, not reasoning |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Better instructions | Can't force determinism |
| **QWED** | Mathematical verification | **Proves correctness formally** |

> QWED doesn't replace these - it **complements** them.

## 🎯 Real Example: The $1M Bug

**User asks AI:** "Calculate compound interest: $100K at 5% for 10 years"

**GPT-4 responds:** "$150,000"  
*(Used simple interest by mistake)*

**With QWED:**
```python
response = client.verify_math(
    query="Compound interest: $100K, 5%, 10 years",
    llm_output="$150,000"
)
# -> ❌ INCORRECT: Expected $162,889.46
#    Error: Used simple interest formula instead of compound
```

**Cost of not verifying:** $12,889 error per transaction 💸
