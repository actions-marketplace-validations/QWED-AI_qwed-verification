## [5.3.0] - 2026-07-25
### SymbolicVerifier: DiagnosticResult Reference Implementation

SymbolicVerifier is the first fully `DiagnosticResult`-conformant verification engine and serves as the reference implementation for future engine migrations. The unified diagnostic model is no longer aspirational — one of 13 engines now demonstrates the complete pattern.

#### Completed (Phase 1 + Phase 2, META #216)
- **Phase 1** — 6 public methods migrated to `DiagnosticResult`: `verify_code`, `verify_function_contract`, `verify_safety_properties`, `verify_bounded`, `analyze_complexity`, `get_verification_budget`
- **Phase 2** — All internal code paths produce `AdvisoryCheck` for non-proof-bearing analysis; `developer_fields` provides structured evidence; `verification_mode` field tracks bounded vs. unbounded analysis
- **Fail-closed math bugs (#129-#131)** — All three resolved, ensuring safety constraints always block when out of budget (PRs #217-#219)
- **Key rotation (#224)** — Secure key attestation rotation implemented (PR #232)

#### Version Propagation
- `qwed` (PyPI): `5.2.0` -> `5.3.0`
- `qwed_sdk` (Python): `5.2.0` -> `5.3.0`
- `@qwed-ai/sdk` (NPM): `5.2.0` -> `5.3.0`

- API version marker: `5.2.0` -> `5.3.0`
- Kubernetes deployment image: `5.2.0` -> `5.3.0`

#### Ecosystem Status
- **1 of 13 engines conformant** — SymbolicVerifier as reference implementation
- **Remaining engines tracked under META #216** (12 engines + security hardening + attestation consumption)
- Open audit issues: #162-#164 (Logic/Graph/Reasoning), #205 (SecureCodeExecutor), #221-#231 (security hardening), #191 (attestation consumption)

## [5.2.0] - 2026-06-19
### Architecture: Structured Verification Diagnostics (#204)

Establishes the unified 3-layer `DiagnosticResult` model — the diagnostic contract that all verification engines will conform to. This is an **additive** release: no existing engine return types are changed. Engine conformance is tracked in blocked issues (#129, #130, #131, #133, #134, #162, #163, #164, #190, #205).

#### New: `DiagnosticResult` Model (`src/qwed_new/core/diagnostics.py`)

Three disclosure layers:
- **Layer 1 — Agent-Safe**: `agent_message: str` — agent/model-facing summary, no internals leaked
- **Layer 2 — Developer**: `developer_fields: dict` — structured evidence (constraint_id, advisory_checks, methods_used, evidence)
- **Layer 3 — Proof**: `proof_ref: Optional[str]` — sha256 hash of retained proof artifact; the authority bit

Key design:
- `DiagnosticStatus`: tri-state only (`VERIFIED` / `UNVERIFIABLE` / `BLOCKED`) — no proliferation
- `proof_ref` is the authority bit: present = admissible for control flow, None = reject
- `VERIFIED` requires `proof_ref` — structurally enforced in `__post_init__`
- `AdvisoryCheck`: non-proof-bearing analysis (LLM fallback, NLI, VLM) — `advisory_only=True` enforced
- `compute_proof_ref()`: deterministic sha256 hashing of JSON-serialized evidence
- `from_legacy_dict()`: migration helper for ad-hoc engine dicts (fail-closed states only)
- Both `DiagnosticResult` and `AdvisoryCheck` are `frozen=True` dataclasses — prevents post-construction bypass

#### Version Propagation
- `qwed` (PyPI): `5.1.2` -> `5.2.0`
- `qwed_sdk` (Python): `5.1.1` -> `5.2.0`
- `@qwed-ai/sdk` (NPM): `5.1.2` -> `5.2.0`
- `qwed` (crates.io/Rust): `5.1.2` -> `5.2.0`
- API version marker: `5.1.2` -> `5.2.0`
- Kubernetes deployment image: `5.1.2` -> `5.2.0`

#### Tests
- 83 new tests covering status taxonomy, all 3 layers, authority contract, fail-closed enforcement, advisory checks, proof hashing, serialization round-trip, legacy migration, frozen dataclass immutability, and realistic scenarios drawn from the 10 blocked issues.

#### Included PRs
- `#206` feat(diagnostics): unified 3-layer DiagnosticResult model (#204)

## [5.1.2] - 2026-06-14
### Security: SymPy Expression Injection Fix (CWE-95)

Emergency patch fixing a **High severity (CVSS 8.8) authenticated RCE vulnerability** in SymPy `parse_expr()` across all math verification paths.

#### Security Fix
- **CWE-95 mitigation**: Added `safe_parse_expr()` wrapper with denylist, stripped `__builtins__`, allow-listed math namespace, per-call global dict copy, and post-parse validation. Replaced all 17 direct `parse_expr()` call sites in `main.py`, `verifier.py`, `batch.py`, and `validator.py`.
- **Symbol consistency**: Added `get_safe_symbol()` to ensure calculus variables (`n`, Greek letters) match special SymPy assumptions, preventing incorrect `diff`/`integrate`/`limit` results.
- **Defense-in-depth**: Pre-parse AST depth limit, post-parse SymPy tree depth validation, `sympy.Expr` type enforcement, `extra_symbols` key/value validation, and sanitized exception handling.

#### Fixes and Hardening
- **Cache Redis fail-closed**: Enforced fail-closed Redis backend for distributed cache mode (PR #199).
- **Benchmarks CI**: CodSpeed performance benchmark workflow added (PR #198).
- **TS SDK lockfile**: Restored `package-lock.json` for reliable `npm ci` in publish workflow (PR #197).

#### Included PRs since v5.1.1
- `#197` fix(ts-sdk): lockfile restore for npm ci publish
- `#198` ci: CodSpeed performance benchmarks
- `#199` fix(cache): fail-closed Redis backend for distributed mode
- `#200` fix(math): restrict sympy expression parsing (CWE-95)

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-21
### Release Consistency and Fail-Closed Follow-Through

Patch release packaging the post-v5.1.0 trust-boundary and fail-closed corrections into a coherent publishable state across core package metadata, SDKs, deployment references, and release automation.

#### Trust Boundary and Correctness Fixes
- **Cache trust-context binding**: Bound verification cache artifacts to provider/model/policy/session trust context to prevent cross-context replay.
- **Attestation hardening**: Strengthened attestation verification with fail-closed behavior and follow-up review remediations.
- **Audit integrity improvements**: Tightened audit logging semantics around malformed payload handling, organization isolation, and transactional durability.
- **Proof-path corrections**: Refined reasoning, symbolic, batch, and agent-service fail-closed behavior where proof prerequisites or safe defaults were ambiguous.

#### Release and Deployment Alignment
- **Version propagation**: Aligned core package, API version marker, Python SDK metadata, TypeScript SDK metadata, and Rust SDK crate version on `5.1.1`.
- **Container reference alignment**: Updated Kubernetes deployment example to the published Docker Hub image/tag convention.
- **Release metadata cleanup**: Prepared package metadata and deployment references for a clean `v5.1.1` publish flow.

#### Included PRs and merged work since v5.1.0
- `#157` docs: README follow-up
- `#158` fix(docker): python 3.13 upgrade follow-up
- `#159` chore(deps): npm/yarn dependency follow-up in `sdk-ts`
- `#160` fix(schema): strict additional-properties enforcement follow-up
- `#161` fix(symbolic): fail closed when no proof exists
- `#168` fix(executor): secure executor fail-closed follow-up
- `#176` fix(agent): deny and handle unknown agent actions safely
- `#177` fix(reasoning): require proof prerequisites before reasoning acceptance
- `#178` and `#192` fix(cache): bind verification cache keys to trust context and address review follow-ups
- `#179` fix(audit): fail-closed audit logging, chain isolation, and transaction hardening
- `#180` fix(batch): separate batch math simplification from proof path
- `#186` chore(deps): pip dependency maintenance
- `#193` fix(tests): test-secret cleanup and PowerShell encoding hygiene

#### Upgrade Notes
- Deployments using the Kubernetes example should pull `docker.io/qwedai/qwed-verification:5.1.1` instead of the older `ghcr.io/qwed-ai/qwed-core` reference.
- This patch release focuses on stricter semantics, release consistency, and fail-closed enforcement rather than end-user feature expansion.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-19
### Agent State Governance and Fail-Closed Hardening

Minor release expanding QWED from action verification into state governance while closing the adversarial fail-open gaps identified after v5.0.0. This release includes AgentStateGuard plus a focused hardening wave across execution, tool governance, mathematical verification, API semantics, and schema validation.

#### New Capability
- **AgentStateGuard**: Added deterministic state verification with strict structural validation, semantic transition checks, and governed atomic state commits. This extends QWED from action-only verification to state and memory governance.

#### Fail-Closed Hardening
- **Legacy CodeExecutor hard-blocked**: `CodeExecutor.execute()` now raises `RuntimeError` unconditionally. All supported execution remains on `SecureCodeExecutor`.
- **Unknown tools default-denied**: `ToolApprovalSystem` now blocks unknown tools regardless of heuristic risk score.
- **Bounded math tolerance**: `verify_math()` rejects oversized, negative, non-finite, and malformed tolerances instead of letting callers weaken correctness checks.
- **Legacy logic path fails closed**: `verify_logic_rule()` now raises `NotImplementedError` instead of returning `None`.
- **Identity sampling rejected**: `verify_identity()` now returns `BLOCKED` when numerical sampling matches but no formal proof exists.
- **Ambiguous math API rejected**: `/verify/math` now blocks ambiguous implicit-multiplication expressions instead of returning `is_valid: true`.
- **Schema uniqueness fail-closed**: `SchemaVerifier` now emits `uniqueness_validation_error` when `uniqueItems` cannot be proven deterministically.

#### Runtime and Security Follow-Through
- **Progress-aware doom loop guard**: Added LOOP-004 state-aware replay protection for repeated actions on unchanged state.
- **Security and infrastructure hardening**: Incorporated follow-up hardening across configs, CI, and infrastructure.
- **Stats verifier coverage expansion**: Added edge-case coverage for the statistics engine.
- **CodeQL and cleanup follow-ups**: Merged syntax, test, and static-analysis cleanup work after the v5.0.0 boundary release.

#### Upgrade Notes
- `CodeExecutor` is no longer usable as a legacy execution path. Migrate any direct imports to `SecureCodeExecutor`.
- Unknown tools now require explicit allowlisting and are no longer auto-approved at low heuristic risk.
- `verify_math()` may return `BLOCKED` for tolerances that exceed the deterministic policy bound.
- `verify_logic_rule()` no longer returns an ambiguous non-result; callers must migrate to `LogicVerifier`.
- Sampling-only `verify_identity()` matches now return `BLOCKED`, not `UNKNOWN`.
- Ambiguous `/verify/math` expressions now return `BLOCKED` with `is_valid: false`.
- `uniqueItems` validation failures are now explicit schema errors instead of silent passes.

#### SDK and Package Versions
- `qwed` (PyPI): `5.0.0` -> `5.1.0`
- `qwed_sdk` (Python): `5.0.0` -> `5.1.0`
- `@qwed-ai/sdk` (NPM): `5.0.0` -> `5.1.0`

#### Included PRs since v5.0.0

- `#139` feat: AgentStateGuard - full implementation (structural + semantic + atomic commit)
- `#149` fix: hard-block legacy CodeExecutor execution path
- `#150` fix: default deny unknown tool approvals
- `#151` fix: bound verify_math tolerance by computed magnitude
- `#152` fix: fail closed in verify_logic_rule
- `#153` fix: fail closed in verify_identity
- `#154` fix: fail closed for ambiguous math api inputs
- `#155` fix: fail closed on uniqueItems validation errors

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-04
### 🛡️ Enforcement Boundary Hardening

Major release focused on making QWED's verification boundary fail-closed, deterministic about what it proves, and substantially harder to bypass under adversarial conditions. Consolidates 98 commits and 20 merged PRs since v4.0.1, including the full PR 0–5 enforcement hardening series.

#### 🔐 Security Hardening
- **Fail-Closed Verification**: Disabled unsafe in-process execution fallbacks; stats and consensus paths now require secure Docker sandbox.
- **Critical Boundary Closures**: Removed logic verifier `eval()` fallback — raises `RuntimeError` if `SafeEvaluator` is unavailable (CVE-QWED-001).
- **Mandatory Guards**: Agent security guards (Exfiltration, MCP Poison) are now server-enforced and unconditional — `security_checks` field removed from request model.
- **Consensus Rate Limiting**: `/verify/consensus` endpoint now enforces `check_rate_limit` to prevent cost amplification attacks.
- **Self-Attestation Fix**: Consensus fact engine no longer calls `verify_fact(query, query)` — requires external context.
- **Redis Fail-Closed**: `RedisSlidingWindowLimiter` now denies requests on Redis errors instead of allowing them.
- **Timing-Safe Token Verification**: Agent token comparison switched to `hmac.compare_digest`.
- **Metrics Access Control**: `/metrics` and `/metrics/prometheus` now require authenticated admin access.
- **Environment Integrity**: Startup enforces `verify_environment_integrity()` before database initialization.

#### 🧠 Determinism & Trust Boundary
- Natural-language math responses now return `INCONCLUSIVE` when verifying LLM-translated expressions — never `VERIFIED`.
- Added explicit `trust_boundary` metadata in API responses describing what was actually verified.
- `verify_identity()` numerical sampling fallback now returns `UNKNOWN` instead of `LIKELY_EQUIVALENT`.
- Heuristic/non-proof outcomes are honestly labeled instead of presented as formal verification.

#### 🤖 Agent Hardening
- **Action context mandatory**: `verify_action()` requires `ActionContext` with `conversation_id` and `step_number`.
- **Replay detection**: Same `(conversation_id, step_number)` pair blocked (QWED-AGENT-LOOP-002).
- **Loop detection**: Same action repeated 3+ times triggers DENIED (QWED-AGENT-LOOP-003).
- **In-flight step reservations**: Prevents race conditions in concurrent agent calls.
- **Budget denial isolation**: Budget-exceeded denials do not consume conversation state.

#### 📜 Tool Governance (PR 0)
- Added `QWED_RULES.md` — canonical enforcement contract for contributors and tools.
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — blocks Copilot from suggesting fallback execution.
- Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` — mandatory enforcement checklist.
- Extended `.coderabbit.yaml` with enforcement-specific review instructions.

#### 🔧 Supply Chain & CI
- Pinned third-party GitHub Actions to verified commit SHAs.
- Merged security autofix PRs and dependency hardening (#100–#114).

#### 📦 SDK & Package Versions
- `qwed` (PyPI): `4.0.1` → `5.0.0`
- `qwed_sdk` (Python): `2.1.0-dev` → `5.0.0`
- `@qwed-ai/sdk` (NPM): `4.0.1` → `5.0.0`
- TypeScript SDK: Removed `security_checks` from agent verification helpers; `tool_schema` remains.

#### 🧪 Test Coverage
- `test_pr115_regressions.py` — critical boundary closures (eval removal, guard enforcement, consensus rate limit, fact self-attestation).
- `test_pr117_regressions.py` — stats fail-closed behavior, sandbox enforcement.
- `test_pr4_runtime_hardening.py` — Redis fail-closed, agent loop controls, metrics auth, environment integrity.
- `test_pr5_determinism_alignment.py` — trust boundary metadata, INCONCLUSIVE status, numerical sampling UNKNOWN.
- **Sanity sweep**: 162 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failures.

#### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes
- `INCONCLUSIVE` is now a distinct verification status — downstream consumers must handle it.
- `BLOCKED` and `UNKNOWN` are explicit outcomes, not generic failures.
- Agent integrations must provide `ActionContext` with `conversation_id` and `step_number`.
- `/metrics` endpoints now require admin role — update monitoring integrations accordingly.

### 🔄 Sentinel Guard Sync

#### 🆕 New Endpoints
- **`POST /verify/process`**: Glass-box reasoning process verifier — IRAC structural compliance and custom milestone validation with decimal scoring.
- **Agent Security Checks**: `POST /agents/{id}/verify` now accepts `security_checks: { exfiltration, mcp_poison }` to run `ExfiltrationGuard` and `MCPPoisonGuard` before verification.

#### 🔒 Security Fixes
- **Information Disclosure**: Removed raw `str(e)` from `/verify/rag` error responses; exceptions logged via `redact_pii()`, clients receive only `INTERNAL_VERIFICATION_ERROR`. (Sentry + CodeQL)
- **Symbolic Precision**: `RAGVerifyRequest.max_drm_rate` changed from `float | str` → `str` with `field_validator` enforcing Fraction-compatible values.

#### 🛠️ SDK Changes (`@qwed-ai/sdk@4.0.1`)
- **`verifyProcess()`**: Validates AI reasoning traces using IRAC or custom milestone lists.
- **`verifyRAG()`**: `maxDrmRate` type changed from `number` to `string` for symbolic precision.
- **`verifyAgent()`**: Returns `AgentVerificationResponse`, payload aligned with backend schema. Agent IDs URL-encoded.
- **Type Fixes**: `VerificationResultData.risk` and `risk_level` separated. Added `Process`, `RAG`, `Security` to `VerificationType` enum.

#### 🧪 Tests
- `test_api_phase17_endpoints.py` — covers `/verify/process`, `/verify/rag` exception masking, and agent security check blocking.
